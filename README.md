# Homework-one
First homework assigned for CSE-214

The idea of this project is to create a program that acts as a rental store with three bookshelves. The main class contains a menu with options such as "Add Book", "Swap Books", "Loan Book", etc. User will use menu in main file to manipulate *book* **objects** and *bookshelf* **arrays**.
The main class "*RipoffRental.java*" needs to access files "*Book.java*","*Bookshelf.Java*", and "*EmptyShelfException.java*" in order to function.
Descriptions of each class can be found in the respective file.
File "*test.java*" was provided, in order to test the program for errors.
